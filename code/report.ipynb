    "The project is to determine satellite life spans.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, determining the life span of satellites using linear and ordinary linear squared regression. The use of linear regression in general for this project is because life span is an exponential decay problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "By knowing how long a satellite will last, one can plan on whether it needs updated or replaced. Knowing how long a satellite is able to function properly in orbit will benefit those who made and those who use the satellite. The benefits can range from knowing what equipment will work for how long and how well the equipment works in given conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nasa, Lockheed Martain, and similar comapnies would be interested in this project. This would help them in understanding satellite life spans better. In understanding how ling a satellite can last determines if it is used in orbit. Tests are runned by these companies to determine how long a satellite will last rather than how long one can last. \n",
    "\n",
    "There has been work done on satellite's life sapn. [European Space Imagining](https://www.euspaceimaging.com/the-lifespan-of-orbiting-satellites/#:~:text=%20The%20Lifespan%20of%20Orbiting%20Satellites%20%201,a%20concrete%20plan%20for%20clearing%20space...%20More%20) and [Space Academy](https://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/debris/orblife.htm) both have done work on satellites in orbit. The European Space Imaging's acticle is on the lifespan of obriting satellites specifically on what happens to satellites after they are decommissioned and Space Academy's article is on satellite orbital lifetimes depedning on the altitude of the satellite."
